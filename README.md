# tech-news-display
A python program which uses the tkinter module to get news from the BBC technology news section and display it in an easily readable format. It was originally made for displays in a corridor.

At the moment, the program will only work properly on 1920x1080p displays, at their standard scaling.

A newer, web based version is available at [jamietuplin.com](https://jamietuplin.com/newsdisplay/)
